# Basics
## Aim
To learn about the basics of C++ programming
## Theory
C++ is a super of C language. C++ is an object oriented lanugage that is widely regarded as the best language for large scale applications.

C++ supports a wide variety of data types and the programmer can choose which data type is required for his application:
1. Primary or Built-in data types:
   * Integer type (int) --> Integers typically require 4 bytes of memory space and range from -2147483648 to 2147483647.
   * Character (char) --> Character data type is used for storing characters (a-z or A-Z). Characters typically require 1 byte of memory space and range from -128 to 127 or 0 to 255.
   * Boolean (bool) --> Boolean data type is used for storing Boolean or logical values. A Boolean variable can store either true or false.
   * Floating Point (float) --> Floating Point data type is used for storing single-precision floating-point values or decimal values.
   * Double Floating Point (double) --> Double Floating Point data type is used for storing double-precision floating-point values or decimal values.
   * Valueless or Void (void) --> Void means without any value. void data type represents a valueless entity.
   * Wide Character --> Wide character data type is also a character data type but this data type has a size greater than the normal 8-bit data type.
2. Derived Data types:
 Arrays, Pointers etc
3. User defined data types:
 Classes, Structures etc

Before starting our main code we include some header files. For example #include<iostream> which is a basic input output headrer file, we also include the namespace 'std'.

Some basic input output syntax are: 
To take input: ``` cin>>variable_name; ```
To give output: ``` cout<<variable_name;```
